    Unit Test Project : TestAlchemyTypes Project Overview
========================================================================

CxxTest Unit Test Project Wizard has created this TestAlchemyTypes project as a starting point.

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that make up your project.

Unit Test Project.vcproj
    This is the main project file for projects generated using an Application Wizard. 
    It contains information about the version of the product that generated the file, and 
    information about the platforms, configurations, and project features selected with the
    Application Wizard.

This is the list of test suites that are contained in this test unit.
This list covers the basic set of functionality provided by Hg (Mercury),
which is a required component of alchemy.

This is a placeholder file that will be automatically generated by the tool when 
the the list of tests change.  You should not edit this file, your changes
will be lost.

Other notes:

You can add another test suite object to this same project through the class
wizard.  Select the CxxTestFixture project to generate a stub implementation
for your new test suite.  When the test code is generated, it will use all 
of the header files found in the directory you have specified in your Source Path.

You will need to add all of the files to your new project that are required
to test your software component.  You should reference them in the project from
the location where they are currently found relative to the unit test system.
This will insure that when you rerun the test unit project it will detect the 
changes of your development and retest your software.
