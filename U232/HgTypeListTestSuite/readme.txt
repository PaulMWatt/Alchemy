    Unit Test Project : Hgtype_listTestSuite Project Overview
========================================================================

Unit Test Project has created this Hgtype_listTestSuite project for you as a starting point.

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that make up your project.

Unit Test Project.vcproj
    This is the main project file for projects generated using an Application Wizard. 
    It contains information about the version of the product that generated the file, and 
    information about the platforms, configurations, and project features selected with the
    Application Wizard.

Hgtype_listTestSuite.hpp
Place all of your unit tests in this file as a public function with the name
'Test' at the beginning.  The code generator will comb over this file and 
generate a runner that calls all of the 'Test' functions.  There is an example
function by default in this file called:    void TestCase1()

Hgtype_listTestSuiteRunner.cpp
This is a placeholder file that will be automatically generated by the tool when 
the the list of tests change.  You should not edit this file, your changes
will be lost.

Other notes:

You can add another test suite object to this same project through the class
wizard.  Select the L3|CxxTestFixture project to generate a stub implementation
for your new test suite.  When the test code is generated, it will use all 
of the header files found in the directory you have specified in your Source Path.

You will need to add all of the files to your new project that are required
to test your software component.  You should reference them in the project from
the location where they are currently found relative to the unit test system.
This will insure that when you rerun the test unit project it will detect the 
changes of your development and retest your software.
